# Thoth Programming Language

Thoth is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language designed to unify and empower developers with a focus on innovation, adaptability, and knowledge sharing. Named after the ancient Egyptian deity of knowledge and writing, Thoth aims to support a wide range of computing environments, from mechanical computers to quantum systems.

## Language Features

### Multi-Paradigm Support
Thoth supports various programming paradigms:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Procedural Programming
- Declarative Programming
- Structured Programming
- Parallel Computing
- Data-Driven Programming
- Aspect-Oriented Programming
- Event-Driven Programming
- Logic Programming
- Reactive Programming
- Modular Programming
- Markup Languages

### Type System
Thoth provides a robust and flexible type system:
- **Static Typing**: Types are checked at compile time by default.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Types can be checked at runtime if enabled.
- **Strong Typing**: Enforces strict type rules to prevent type errors.
- **Weak Typing**: Allows more flexibility in type conversion.
- **Manifest Typing**: Types must be explicitly declared.
- **Inferred Typing**: Types can be automatically inferred by the compiler.
- **Nominal Typing**: Types are determined by explicit declarations.
- **Structural Typing**: Types are determined by the structure and behavior of objects.
- **Duck Typing**: An objectâ€™s suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties.
- **Latent Typing**: Allows for delayed type checking.

### Precision and Optimization
- **Advanced Evaluation System**: Handles floating-point arithmetic with precision and optimizes equations.
- **Custom Linker**: Allows overriding distribution code for optimization.
- **Unused Code Culling**: Removes unused code to ensure efficient binaries.
- **Built-in Translation**: Supports encoding paradigms with default UTF-8 encoding.

### Scalability
- Supports single systems, distributed systems, and cloud computing.
- Suitable for embedded systems and low-bandwidth devices.
- Native support for parallel and quantum computing.

### Hot Swapping
- Allows live code updates without downtime using `#hotswap=true`.

### Sandboxing and Weaving
- **Sandboxing**: Enables secure execution of code with specific properties.
- **Weaving Paradigms**: Allows nesting and combining different paradigms within the code.

### Compiler Options
- **Pre-JIT, JIT, and Econo-JIT Compilers**: Optimizes code execution for various environments.
